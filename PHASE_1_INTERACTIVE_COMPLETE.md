## 💾 **Local Storage System**

### **How It Works:**

Data is automatically saved to your browser's local storage under these keys:

```javascript
career_dashboard_todos          // 31 TODO items
career_dashboard_applications   // 5 job applications
career_dashboard_weekly_goals   // 5 weekly goals
career_dashboard_skills         // Skills tracking (ready for Phase 2)
```

### **Data Persistence:**

✅ **Survives browser refresh** - Close and reopen, data is still there
✅ **Per-browser storage** - Different browsers have separate data
✅ **No server needed** - Everything stored locally on your device
✅ **Automatic sync** - Changes save instantly

### **Clear Data:**

If you want to reset everything:
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear();
// Then refresh the page
```
